A sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 
Applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms. 
Utilized TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. 
Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), CatBoost Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier combined with a Decision Tree base learner to improve model performance through boosting. 
Conducted a Randomized Search to optimize AdaBoost parameters, enhancing model accuracy and performance. 
Assessed model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score, and Cohen's Kappa score.
